other company’s culture: A common mistake people make in building their own culture is taking other company’s culture and using it for your own company. In other words, stealing the culture. While it may work for some, it usually does not for the rest. Focus on what your company needs and are aiming for instead looking into what other companies are doing. Remember, what works for another company may not work with yours!\\nBuild a culture without planning: One of the mistakes to avoid when building a company culture is starting out a culture without planning. A company culture is a matter of determining what is important for the company; setting the tone and direction. It is all about actions and behaviors.\\nLeadership absence most of the time: Leadership presence has a great influence on how people experience the work environment. If leaders are absent most of the time due to meetings or away on some conferences, they are missing the main opportunity to shape the culture and environment of the company.\\nLack of communication: To establish a strong business relationship, effective communication practices must be established from the start. Make sure the team knows what is expected of them. Poor communication will strain the productivity of the company. Being aware of such problem is the first step toward solving them. Remember that positive communication is the key to a positive culture.\\nSpreading negativity: Leaders must set the tone of the company. A leader should be aware of the mood and what type of energy one is spreading to the team.  Spreading negativity, even if unintentional, creates an unhealthy culture that severely hampers results. \\nLong-term and short-term goals: A mistake to avoid when building the company culture is not having goals, regardless if it is long-term or short-term. Goals motivate us to be focused and productive.\\nMake poor hiring decisions: Building a great company culture is impossible if the organization keeps making bad hiring decisions. If a company has to choose between skills and cultural fit, remember that one can train anyone for skills; however you cannot train someone to change the characteristics that define them.\\nImplement meaningless or illogical rules: A mistake to avoid when building the company culture is having rules that do not make sense. When setting up ground rules do not forget to ask if there is a good reason for them. \\nOverlooking social needs: Most employees do not want to just show up at work and leave. They want a meaningful work experience. \\r\\n","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":152}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":307,"height":2440,"strokewidth":0}},"width":306,"height":2440,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6eUvI2lI59d"}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":382,"yPos":120,"tabIndex":6,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":159.5,"rotateYPos":200.5,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"rotation":0,"depth":6,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"html5data":{"url":"","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":319,"height":401,"strokewidth":0}},"width":319,"height":401,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"background":{"type":"vector","vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":319,"bottom":401,"altText":"Scroll 1","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":151}}},"id":"6ggI2iItSDc"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":false,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
