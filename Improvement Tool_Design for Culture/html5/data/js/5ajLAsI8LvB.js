management quality-related activities will take about 10^%^ of the managers’ time—a heavy price to be paid by people who have many other demands on their time. (Establishing “proof of the need” is essential to convincing upper management to make the time investment.) When upper management spends time on these activities, it provides the evidence of leadership that inspires others to do their share.\\nSome upper management groups have chosen to be highly visible in the quality process by leading quality training. In such cases, managers at a variety of levels personally conduct some of the managerial training for their subordinates. Sometimes, the concepts presented are emphasized by the manager/instructor in everyday practice.\\nA further form of evidence is upper management quality improvement teams. Each team, consisting solely of upper management members, addresses a problem that requires attention at its level. Examples include the effectiveness of the product development process, the quality of decision making in selecting new product managers, and the administrative aspects of high warranty costs.\\nThe visibility of upper management taking such training and then conducting such projects sets an example for other levels to follow.\\nOccasionally, upper management has opportunities to take dramatic action to demonstrate its commitment to quality. Here are some examples:\\nA manufacturer of tires traditionally sold, at a discount, tires that had imperfections. (These imperfections had no impact on safety.) The sales income from these “seconds” made an important contribution to total sales income. A policy decision was made to discontinue all sales of tires with imperfections. The policy, one part of a broader company emphasis on quality, sent a strong message to all employees that quality was a top priority.\\nA manufacturer of a small electronic product had always emphasized quality but found it necessary to rework about 8^%^ of production. A potential customer objected to the rework concept, claiming that the rework might degrade the overall quality. (That customer was not satisfied that the product would be retested after rework.) The manufacturer announced that no rework would be permitted and that any non- conforming product would be discarded. In this case, the strong message proclaimed by the policy helped to uncover many hidden causes of defects that had previously been tolerated and corrected by rework.\\nOne major utility requires department managers to submit and obtain approval of their departmental budget each year. This organization also requires each manager to prepare an annual quality plan. Each quality plan must be approved before the annual budget is approved.\\nA government agency had a reporting system on work output. Managers were evaluated on the quantity of output results versus goals. As the agency moved to a quality- oriented culture, the director took drastic action to demonstrate his feeling about the priority on quality. He discontinued the reports on output (even though he still had output goals from a higher level) and told his people that quality was the top prior- ity. He explained that improvement in quality would contribute to meeting output goals by reducing the time spent on reprocessing activities due to poor quality.\\r\\nSuch dramatic actions are inspiring, even though they are rare.\\nA particularly sensitive issue that has a major impact on quality culture is job security. The turmoil of downsizing and outsourcing understandably causes major apprehensions among employees. Employees correctly understand that improving quality to increase sales may create jobs, but they are concerned that reducing errors and other forms of waste may eliminate jobs. (“Am I working myself out of a job by participating in this quality improvement team?”) How upper management handles this issue makes a deep impression on employees. \\nProviding evidence of leadership may involve changes in the way management interacts with employees, i.e., the “style of leadership.” A prerequisite to such change is understanding the present style. A division of the Rockwell Corporation decided that understanding the style was a key element in gaining employee support for quality. A survey was made to determine the management style of the president, his direct reports, and the people who reported to the direct reports (Warren, 1989). The management team exhibited six leadership styles: coercive, authoritative, affiliative, democratic, pace set- ting, and coaching. The predominant style was pace setting (“The do-it-myself manager who performs many tasks personally, expects subordinates to follow his or her example and motivates by setting high standards and letting subordinates work on their own”). Although the pacesetting style had advantages, it was not deemed suitable for changing the organization or gaining employee support. (Pace- setters often take over a job themselves, have trouble delegating, are intolerant of mis- takes, etc.) Further analysis revealed that a better management style is one where management prides a vision, sets clear standards and goals, shows individuals what is expected of them, lets employees do the job, and gives feedback along with rewards. A coaching process was developed to help managers change their style.\\nThe matter of leadership for quality applies to all levels of management. Middle management and supervision must take the initiative to act as leaders in quality. In an innovative approach, the CEO of SSM Health Care (a system that includes 21 hospitals) calls for everyone in her organization to be leaders for continuous improvement. Middle management, in particular, is encouraged and expected to create a work environment for improvement (Ryan, 1999). Some organizations tell personnel that they have two jobs—one is in their job description; their other job is improvement.\\nDeFeo and Barnard (2004) point out that achieving performance breakthrough requires a highly supportive culture. Certain cultural norms appear to be instrumental in providing the needed support. Some of the more enabling norms are:\\nA belief that the quality of a product or process is at least of equal importance and probably of greater importance than the mere quantity produced.\\nA fanatic commitment to meeting customer needs.\\nA fanatic commitment to stretch goals and to continuous improvement.\\nA belief that there should be no “sacred cows.”\\nA customer-oriented code of conduct and code of ethics.\\nA belief that continuous adaptive change is not only good, but necessary.\\nCultural patterns helpful in achieving performance breakthrough are:\\nA collaborative, as opposed to a competitive mode of performing work.\\nA generally participative, as opposed to a generally authoritarian management style.\\nA high level of trust (feeling safe), as opposed to a high level of fear (feeling unsafe, unwilling to offer true opinions, or take stands or risks). For example, messengers bearing “bad” news must not be shot.\\r\\n\\n","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":224}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":615,"height":2397,"strokewidth":0}},"width":615,"height":2397,"resume":true,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6nd7JQrUUDA"}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":40,"yPos":114,"tabIndex":2,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":321.5,"rotateYPos":176,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"rotation":0,"depth":4,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"html5data":{"url":"","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":643,"height":352,"strokewidth":0}},"width":643,"height":352,"resume":true,"useHandCursor":true,"background":{"type":"vector","vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":643,"bottom":352,"altText":"Scroll 1","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":209}}},"id":"6WBcHInBoL4"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":true,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
