The responsibility may rest with the President, VP-Operations, Office of Lean Enterprise, Lean Manager, or others.\\n\\n3.2\\tThe Team Leader is responsible for ensuring that the activities required for a successful RIE are completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.0\\tPROCEDURE \\n\\n4.1\\tJob Security:\\n\\n4.1.1\\tRapid Improvement Events require up front planning. Conducting an event requires a large commitment of resources over a short period of time. Rapid Improvement Teams must have ready access to needed resources during the event in order to meet their objectives. Many problems that develop during a Rapid Improvement Event are avoidable and are largely due to ineffective planning. This section is intended to highlight some of the issues that must be addressed prior to conducting a Rapid Improvement Event. Remember, Rapid Improvement Events can be intense, often stressful situations. There is considerable pressure to achieve results in a short period of time.\\n\\n4.1.2\\tIt doesn\'t take long for most employees to figure out that they could Rapid Improve themselves out of a job. Consequently, it must be clearly communicated to everyone involved the company policy defining job security or potential elimination that occur from productivity improvements if management wants their full interest in, support of, and commitment to the Rapid Improvement effort. Although a No-Layoff Policy is typically a key to successful Rapid Improvement Events and the continuous improvement cycle, excellence and improvement should be expected. Unsatisfactory performers and non-performers should not be protected by the no-layoff policy. Likewise, a decline in business can result in reductions in staffing. Each organization should complete it’s own policy. \\n\\n4.1.3\\tThe policy must be communicated and discussed openly with the workforce. A member of senior management with the authority to define and communicate policy should do so in a clear and unambiguous way. This responsibility is not something that can be delegated. Initial skepticism about the policy can only be overcome by effectively following through on the policy. While some re-assignments are unavoidable, every effort should be made to retain the skills and knowledge of displaced workers in an operation since their cumulative experience is a valuable resource. In unionized environments, seniority and/or other contractual features may determine displacement bumping which can have a ripple effect across the entire plant. This domino effect is almost always very disruptive to operations. Attractive alternatives such as a meaningful new assignment may pre-empt any bumping.\\n\\n4.1.4\\tBecause displacement is a source of considerable anxiety and stress, effective planning for displaced employees is very important. Some typical ways to approach this are as follows: \\n\\n4.1.4.1\\tAssign displaced employees to the Lean Office support function\\n4.1.4.2\\tIn-source work\\n4.1.4.3\\tEliminate temporary employees \\n4.1.4.4\\tBuild business and enter new niches\\n4.1.4.5\\tSpecial projects, including Rapid Improvement Event planning and follow-up\\n4.1.4.6\\tExpedite new product introductions\\n4.1.4.7\\tCross training\\n\\n4.1.5\\tIn addition to retraining and reassigning displaced workers, there should be pay-grade protection. There shouldn\'t be a financial disincentive to individuals who contribute during the improvement of their line. This may become an issue if an operator is displaced and reassigned to a new area. In addition, it will almost always be an issue when multi-skilling (cross-training), which spans several previous pay grades, is introduced within a cell environment.\\n\\n4.1.6\\tManagement should spend time communicating to all affected personnel what a Rapid Improvement Event involves. The more familiar people are with the event prior to its occurrence, the more receptive they will be during the event. Communications about what a Rapid Improvement Event is and why it is needed must be consistent from all sources-senior management, corporate personnel, and line operating management. Management should explain how Rapid Improvement Events fit the overall strategic plan. If people understand the big picture of incremental, continuous improvement, they tend to understand its benefits.\\n\\n4.1.7\\tThe more directly someone is affected by an event, the more personal the communications should be. A facility wide posting may suffice to notify all personnel that an event is occurring and what its objectives are. However, it should not serve as a substitute for a management representative personally meeting with those who regularly work in the area prior to the event to answer any questions or allay any fears. Rumors should not be ignored. They provide a good early warning sign of employee concern and should be viewed as a line of communication. \\n\\n4.2\\tMaintenance/Support Considerations:\\n\\n4.2.1\\tProduction equipment or other equipment may be re-arranged during a Rapid Improvement Event. Such an undertaking is only made possible through the active support of local maintenance/support personnel. While the team will help in any way it can, maintenance/support will largely be responsible for disconnecting the equipment, physically moving it, and then running new utilities to get it back under power and running. The expectation is to accomplish this in a relatively short period of time (24 hrs) so that the team may continue to refine and document the new work methods with the equipment in its new configuration.\\n\\n4.2.2\\tBecause maintenance personnel are frequently crucial to a Rapid Improvement Event’s success, they should be fully informed on what to expect during the event. It is important to obtain their participation and cooperation. The need for and role of outside contractors should be fully discussed.\\n\\n4.2.3\\tArrange for maintenance to review the areas where the Rapid Improvement Event is to occur so they can get an idea of what the potential needs may be. This allows them to line up any special equipment that might be needed. Also, maintenance should make sure they have a sufficient supply of hoses, wiring, connectors, and other supplies that may be required to accommodate layout changes during the event. Plywood and planks should also be on hand to allow the team to mock up tables, slides, or other fixtures to simulate prospective process changes. \\n\\n4.2.4\\tMake sure maintenance knows what Rapid Improvement Events are all about, what is expected of them (working late into the night when a layout gets changed, etc.), and why the company is doing it. Generally, support from maintenance will not be required until late in the afternoon on the second day. \\n\\n4.3\\tSelecting the Focus Area: \\n\\n4.3.1\\tThe focus area for the Rapid Improvement Event needs to be strategic and important to the company\'s success. Keep in mind what is required in terms of time and resources, and the resulting impact on productivity. Several strategies may be used to select a target area. \\n\\n4.3.2\\tYou may choose to focus on a specific product line or process. When using this strategy, start with a core line with strategic significance and sufficient potential impact. Usually these are the higher volume processes. Or you may choose to focus on specific products or services depending upon your processes. Some companies choose individual products/services on the basis of profitability-less profitable products are focused on first. Avoid products/services that are being phased out, for instance, when the market has entered a severe decline. \\n\\n4.3.3\\tAreas with specific operating problems may be targets for Rapid Improvement projects. When choosing these areas, be careful to consider whether the operating problems will improve with the application of the Rapid Improvement principles centered on quality, cost, and delivery. \\n\\n4.3.4\\tLarge processes can be used for a Rapid Improvement Event; however, they need to be broken down into manageable pieces so that one team is not trying to do too much. Fewer operators may not result in enough work for the team, and more operators may be too large a process for one team to handle. This is only meant to be a guideline, however, and specific circumstances may necessitate choosing a focus area with more or less operators. \\n\\n4.3.5\\tLook to create vertical one-piece flow whenever possible. When getting started you should choose a line where people are most likely to respond well to change, and the benefits are easily attainable as well as visible to build momentum for future Rapid Improvement Events. \\n\\n4.3.6\\tDepending on facility size, one, two, or three areas should be identified initially as the focus of Rapid Improvement efforts. By focusing efforts on select areas and revisiting them often, more synergy will be realized from the events. Each Rapid Improvement Event will tend to reveal new issues to be addressed. New issues should serve as a compass to provide direction for subsequent events. This approach is an excellent way to build a critical mass of knowledge and depth of understanding internally regarding Value Stream Management and Rapid Improvement Events. Once this learning is well established within the model line area, it becomes much easier to transfer this knowledge to other areas of the plant. \\n\\n4.3.6.1\\tUse the following criteria to select the target area for the Rapid Improvement Event:  \\n\\n4.3.6.1.1\\tStrategic impact (opportunity to improve quality, cost, or delivery) \\n4.3.6.1.2\\tMaterial/Information flow position (start at delivery/installation, then work backwards through the processes to raw material) \\n4.3.6.1.3\\tSize (a RIE team can ideally handle a process with 6-10 operators per shift) \\n4.3.6.1.4\\tAn experienced facilitator can manage two teams if experienced team leaders are available \\n4.3.6.1.5\\tAvailability (impact on production/customer delivery), there          will be some down-time during the event \\n\\n4.3.6.2\\tDefine Scope:\\rUse the following guidelines to define an appropriate scope for the team: \\n\\n4.3.6.2.1\\tThe scope should focus the team on an appropriate segment of the process on which to work \\n4.3.6.2.2\\tToo broad of scope may diffuse the teams efforts and make it difficult to come to closure during the work shop \\n4.3.6.2.3\\tToo narrow of scope may inhibit the team from exploring creative alternatives to the current processing \\n\\nScopes usually state from where the team should consider the process to begin to where the team should consider the process to end.\\n\\n4.4\\tSetting Event Objectives:\\n\\n4.4.1\\tEach team must have clear objectives. These objectives should be set in advance of the event and with senior management\'s input to insure consistency with strategic goals. \\n4.4.1.1.1\\tSuggested areas to measure include:\\r\\n4.4.1.1.1.1\\tSafety / Ergonomics\\n4.4.1.1.1.2\\tLead Time\\n4.4.1.1.1.3\\tWIP Inventory (Items)\\n4.4.1.1.1.4\\tQuantity (Items produced per day)\\n4.4.1.1.1.5\\tOperators (Number of people required per day)\\n4.4.1.1.1.6\\tProductivity (Items produced per person per day)\\n4.4.1.1.1.7\\tSquare Footage (Floor space required)\\n4.4.1.1.1.8\\tMaterial Flow Distance\\n4.4.1.1.1.9\\tSet-up Time\\n4.4.1.1.1.10\\tQuality (Defects, scrap, yields, etc.)\\n\\n4.4.2\\tSet specific improvement targets for the four or five most important, quantifiable objectives. They should be attainable, but challenging at the same time.  Realize that objectives are partially based on estimates. Accordingly, the team may not achieve all of them. Consequently, an events success should not be measured strictly in terms of whether or not objectives were met. Any good improvement constitutes success. \\n\\n4.4.3\\tTeam Leaders are responsible for communicating the objectives to the team and making sure they understand them. \\n\\n4.5\\tSelecting Team Members:\\n\\n4.5.1\\tTotal team size, including the Team Leader, should normally be between eight and twelve people. Because a good mix of team members facilitates creativity, idea generation, and fresh viewpoints, approximately half of the team should be from outside the immediate work area (logistics, customer service, field services, quality, purchasing, sales/marketing, human resources, engineering, etc.). Consider inviting customers and/or suppliers to participate as team members. Not only does this contribute to the ongoing relationship, but also it brings in an outsider with unique perspectives which are often much broader than the immediate process. Customers and suppliers can often provide valuable insight into sources of waste throughout the entire value-delivery chain. Suppliers often possess valuable technical knowledge about the processes that use their products. \\n\\n4.5.2\\tHowever, each team must also have multiple members who are very familiar with the target area.  Such people are extremely valuable resources because their detailed knowledge facilitates making changes. They may tend to reassure the other operators in the area who are not team members and are often better able to secure their co-workers\' cooperation. \\n\\n4.5.3\\tSome operations select team members by asking for volunteers. Giving line operators, who may feel left out of the process, a chance to volunteer for team duty helps to establish trust and empowerment. Other plants find it effective to \\"seed\\" the teams with specific members based on skill, knowledge, and enthusiasm. Which approach to take is up to management\'s discretion, but should be consistent with the local culture. \\n\\n4.5.4\\tTeam members are expected to participate full-time during a RIE.  All external distractions should be eliminated and/or relieved. \\n\\n4.6\\tSelecting Team Leaders:\\n\\n4.6.1\\tTeam Leaders make the difference between a good event and a really great one. They are primarily responsible for meeting the event objectives through an effective team process, and are in a unique position to influence the magnitude of any gains. Team Leaders are the single most important people at a Rapid Improvement Event. Accordingly, they should be carefully chosen, in advance, based on their leadership role and bias for action. \\n\\n4.6.2\\tTeam Leader candidates should have previous successful experience in leadership roles and know something about the process where the event is to take place, but generally should not be involved in the line\'s operation on a day-to-day basis. If the Team Leader has too much ownership in the current work methods, he/she may influence the team to resist suggested improvements in work practices or may steer the team toward their own preconceived notion of how the process should function. \\n\\n4.6.3\\tTeam Leaders must have a participative management style to act as a coach or facilitator. Conversely, they must be able to take control and delegate if necessary. These candidates should also be very enthusiastic about continuous improvement and value stream management and its impact on the business. \\n\\n4.6.4\\tManagement should involve the Team Leaders, as much as is practical, in the planning process so that they are familiar with the selected process, the strategic reason for selecting it, and the events objectives. \\n\\n4.7\\tRapid Improvement Events & Quality Management System Standards:\\n\\n4.7.1\\tIt is important to realize that continuous improvement is considered an important aspect of complying with these standards. Rapid Improvement Events generate change while the Quality Management System Standards (ISO 9000, QS-9000, etc.) demand continuous improvement and managing that change. Not managing the change can have very serious and sometimes disastrous effects on quality. A seemingly innocent change can have a very negative impact on processing and on the ultimate use of the product at a customer site.\\n\\n4.7.2\\tWhen applying solutions in Rapid Improvement Events, it is important to remember that some customers require notification for the following:\\n\\n4.7.2.1\\tUse of another optional construction or material\\n4.7.2.2\\tProduction from new or modified tools (except perishable tools)\\n4.7.2.3\\tProduction following refurbishment or re-arrangement of equipment\\n4.7.2.4\\tProduction following any change in process or method of manufacture\\n4.7.2.5\\tProduction from a different plant location\\n\\n4.7.3\\tIn short, the Quality Management System Standards require that both systems and work methods are documented, and that the documented methods be followed in practice. When improved methods of working are discovered such as in a Rapid Improvement Event, these methods should be implemented quickly, but with due course for their potential impact on downstream processes. Once implemented, documentation should be brought up-to-date in a timely fashion to reflect these changes. Management should not allow the Quality Management System Standards to serve as an excuse or roadblock to making improvements\\n\\n4.8\\tEvent Implementation\\n\\n4.8.1\\tSee Juran Institute Inc.’s training materials for specific information related to timetables.  Some general thoughts regarding event implementation are:\\n\\n4.8.1.1\\t  Notify Support Functions:\\rNotify ALL functional area managers of the targeted area and dates for the Rapid Improvement Event. Plans should be made to run inventory in those affected areas if needed for equipment availability during the RIE.\\r\\n4.8.1.1.1\\tThe maintenance/support staff should begin preparation to support the Rapid Improvement Event, considering the following:\\n\\n4.8.1.1.1.1\\tSchedule personnel to adequately support (potentially three shift coverage) the RIE team (electrician\'s, riggers, etc.). Consider outside contractors if required. (NOTE: RIE’s can quickly drain resources from the normal operating maintenance team, so be sure to have enough support.)\\n4.8.1.1.1.2\\tObtain sufficient supplies, tools, and equipment (flexible hook-ups for air and electricity, hoses, wiring, cleaning supplies, forklifts, etc.) \\n4.8.1.1.1.3\\tEnsure equipment/supplies and an adequate work area for the RIE team is available to build such items as racks, tables, and material containers (saws, wood, plastic, cardboard, duct tape, various colored tape (red, green, yellow, blue, etc.), hammers, nails, etc.)\\n4.8.1.1.1.4\\tUsing the proper internal department as the customer contact, invite the customer to participate in the event as necessary \\n4.8.1.1.1.5\\tNotify outside suppliers that could possibly participate in the Rapid Improvement Event with the understanding of the time commitment-Four days of uninterrupted participation\\n4.8.1.1.1.6\\tSAFETY must be kept in mind throughout the activity \\n4.8.1.1.1.7\\tDetermine if any government agencies will have to be notified due to changes in processing (Emissions, hazardous materials, etc.)\\r\\n4.8.1.2\\tReview  the RIE Checklist: \\rUse the attached RIE Checklist to ensure that all items are being covered as required for a successful event.\\n\\n4.8.1.3\\tIdentify Team Members: \\r\\n4.8.1.3.1\\tSelect the team members and team leader with care. Team size should be roughly between eight and twelve people. Half the team should be familiar with the production process (operators, supervisors, engineers, schedulers, etc.) and half should be from outside the area .\\n4.8.1.3.2\\tOne member of the team should be designated as the Team Leader. This designation can be a critical decision for the success of the event. Team leaders should be carefully chosen, in advance, based on their success in leadership roles, prior RIE experience, and bias for action. Rookies, dominators, non-participants, and people critical of new ideas do not make good RIE Team Leaders. He/she should be familiar with the process, understand the strategic reason for selecting it, and have some ownership in the event objectives. The consultant/facilitator will look to the Team Leader to manage team assignments (Action Items, Task Assignments, Time to Reconvene, Debriefing, etc.). Consequently, while the Team Leader must act as a coach, he/she must be willing to delegate and/or direct the team as necessary. The Team Leader may also be called upon as the \\"go to\\" person if roadblocks need to be removed to obtain resources from within the organization. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.8.1.4\\tSend Out Notification: \\r \\n4.8.1.4.1\\tCommunicate to the entire organization the purpose of the Rapid Improvement Event. This can be accomplished by posting a plant-wide notice. In addition to such a notice, a management representative should address the workforce in the areas that are to be included in the event. This could take the form of a supervisor informing the employees (on all shifts, if applicable) what may transpire in their area (Stop watches, equipment moving, work content changes, etc.), and answering any questions they may have during a regularly scheduled meeting (Morning meeting, safety meeting, etc.). It\'s a good idea to have the operators that have been selected for the upcoming event (from each shift, if possible) solicit improvement ideas from their shift\'s other members to be used in the Rapid Improvement Event. \\n\\n4.8.1.4.2\\tPublish an invitation memo to all management (be sure to include Customer Service, Sales, Field Service, and Logistics management of those areas affected, and others as determined) to attend the summary presentation on the last day of the Rapid Improvement Event. \\n\\n4.8.1.4.3\\tReserve a large room equipped with tables, chairs, easels, white boards, overhead projector, screen, and VCR/TV for the classroom training the first day and the summary presentation the last day. The room should comfortably seat 10-20 people in addition to the team for the final presentation. \\n\\n4.8.1.5\\tReview Logistics:\\n\\n4.8.1.5.1\\tReserve a quiet breakout room for each RIE team (approximately 8-12 people) that is equipped with table, chairs and easels for the team to use during the event. Note that teams need to get away from the work area to think, strategize, and discuss, but should not be allowed to dwell too long on these issues. The focus should be out in the work are. Also ensure that video equipment is available (camcorder, video tapes, and VCR/TV). The walls in the breakout room should allow for charts and layouts to be taped or tacked to the walls. In many cases, if there is only one team, the breakout room will be the same room as the training was held in the first day. \\n\\n4.8.1.5.2\\tArrange for healthy food for the team, operators, and maintenance staff for a light breakfast, lunch, and dinner as applicable. \\n\\n4.8.1.5.3\\tReview the RIE Checklist again to make sure all logistical items have been covered. \\n\\n4.8.1.6\\tCompile Project Area Statistics:  \\r\\n4.8.1.6.1\\tCompile pertinent information about the project area.  The statistics should only contain existing, available data. There is no need to perform any studies or create data in any other way. Pertinent information might include:\\r\\n4.8.1.6.1.1\\tInput from operators gathered prior to the event \\n4.8.1.6.1.2\\tDefect/Reject / Scrap Information\\n4.8.1.6.1.3\\tForecasted customer requirements or historical shipments made \\n4.8.1.6.1.4\\tSPC charts\\n4.8.1.6.1.5\\tProduct/Service/Process descriptions (Pictures, assembly drawings, etc.) \\n4.8.1.6.1.6\\tPreventative maintenance schedule\\n4.8.1.6.1.7\\tCurrent staffing requirements\\n4.8.1.6.1.8\\tFlow diagrams (Raw material to finished goods)\\n4.8.1.6.1.9\\tProduct families\\n4.8.1.6.1.10\\tDowntime history\\n4.8.1.6.1.11\\tKnown safety / ergonomic issues\\r\\n4.8.1.6.2\\tDistribute this information to those who will be participating in the Rapid Improvement Event. Don\'t forget to send these to outside guests as well. Inform everyone that they should bring this information with them to the event. \\r\\n\\n4.8.1.7\\tKick-Off: \\rSchedule a member of management to kick-off the Rapid Improvement Event, covering the following subjects: \\r\\n4.8.1.7.1\\tReinforce \\"why\\" the Rapid Improvement Event is important\\n4.8.1.7.2\\tDiscuss job security policy \\n4.8.1.7.3\\tMotivate the team to embrace change\\n4.8.1.7.4\\tGive the participants a \\"license\\" to Just-Do-It\\n4.8.1.7.5\\tEmphasize the importance of safety\\n\\n\\n4.8.1.8\\tTeam Leadership: \\r\\n4.8.1.8.1\\tThe Team Leader should begin the session by covering safety practices in the plant, food/logistic arrangements, housekeeping considerations for both the breakout room and the work area, location of restrooms, and the week’s agenda. Also, the team leader should emphasize the importance of returning from breaks on time, reconvening as a team at the designated time after working in subgroups, and staying focused on the RIE-individuals can\'t contribute fully to the event as well as do their regular job during an event no matter what some people may think! \\n\\n4.8.1.8.2\\tDuring the Rapid Improvement Event, the Team Leader\'s role is to:\\n\\n4.8.1.8.2.1\\tEnsure that the process moves along. There is much to be accomplished in a short, intense time frame. The leader must facilitate the \\"to do list\\", specifically detailing WHO will do WHAT and WHEN. \\n4.8.1.8.2.2\\tFacilitate involvement by all participants without getting bogged down in \\"paralysis by analysis\\". After adequate discussion, the Just-Do-It attitude must prevail, even if the action is a simulation to see if the idea works.  \\n4.8.1.8.2.3\\tIf desired by management, participate in a daily late afternoon Team Leader Meeting. The purpose of the Team Leader Meeting is to review the progress and proposals. Team Leader Meetings are also helpful in ensuring that the team\'s direction and management\'s objectives remain aligned by providing a forum for adjusting goals if necessary. Management\'s involvement in Team Leader Meetings also allows potential roadblocks to be addressed much earlier in the process. The meetings are intended to be brief and to-the-point. \\n4.8.1.8.2.4\\tConduct team update meetings at the beginning and end of each day and as needed during the day. \\n4.8.1.8.2.5\\tRemain sensitive to the impact of the changes on those working in the area and, if needed, ensure communication of the changes to those workers not on the team especially those on Second or Third shift. \\n4.8.1.8.2.6\\tRemove any barriers standing in the way of the team completing their work. \\n4.8.1.8.2.7\\tReinforce safety as a focus. \\n4.8.1.8.2.8\\tFacilitate preparation of the summary presentation at the end of the Rapid Improvement Event. The presentation should be no more than 30-45 minutes in length and all team members should participate by delivering a piece of it. \\r\\n4.8.1.8.3\\tThe presentation should roughly follow this format though some allowance should be made for the exact nature of each particular event: \\r\\n4.8.1.8.3.1\\tIntroduce the team by each participant\'s name\\n4.8.1.8.3.2\\tReview the Scope and Objectives\\n4.8.1.8.3.3\\tPresent Takt-Time calculation\\n4.8.1.8.3.4\\tPresent \\"Before\\" situation \\n4.8.1.8.3.5\\tOld Layout / Material Flow Staffing requirements  / Takt-Time Bar Chart/ WIP levels Etc. \\n4.8.1.8.3.6\\t Implemented Examples (3-5)\\n4.8.1.8.3.7\\tPresent \\"After\\" situation New Layout/ Material Flow Staffing requirements / Takt-Time Bar Chart/ WIP levels - Show one example Etc. \\n4.8.1.8.3.8\\tResults Summary\\n4.8.1.8.3.9\\tQuestions, comments and remarks\\n\\t\\n\\nRapid Improvement Toolbox Kit\\n\\nBox of pencils; mechanical or standard\\nBox of pens, ball point\\nPencil Sharpener (in using standard pencils)\\nBox of erasers\\nReam of Standard Legal Pads (letter is acceptable)\\nNecessary Training Materials\\nBox of Flip Chart Markers\\nBox of Dry Erase Markers\\n1 bottle Dry erase board cleaner\\n1 dry erase board eraser\\n1 bag of rags or wipes\\n1-2 Flip Chart easels\\n5 Flip Chart pads  (Post-It pads are best)\\nSeveral dozen 3x5 post-it notes (different colors)\\nOther materials based on project type\\nSeveral Stop Watches","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":186}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":661,"height":12265,"strokewidth":0}},"width":661,"height":12265,"resume":true,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6JMZaILhpCY"}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":14,"yPos":99,"tabIndex":2,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":340.5,"rotateYPos":155.5,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"rotation":0,"depth":5,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"html5data":{"url":"","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":681,"height":311,"strokewidth":0}},"width":681,"height":311,"resume":true,"useHandCursor":true,"background":{"type":"vector","vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":681,"bottom":311,"altText":"Scroll 1","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":185}}},"id":"6A749c6yC2F"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":true,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
